    <center><h2>About Me</h2></center><!-- Centered section title -->

    <p><font size="+1">Hi! I'm Ellen, Owner & Creator of Pet Sitting Rubs&Hugs. Pet owner and animal lover. I'm originally from SÃ£o Paulo, a big city located in Brazil.
    In 2018 I graduated college, I studied Veterinary Science for 5 years and obtained a Bachelor`s degree at Anhembi Morumbi University. 
    While studying English in the US during my exchange program, I started to miss my cat and hamster back home and decided to start following my passion and care for animals again.
    I've been so lucky to make such good furry friends throughout my journey. The love and care I provide for each one is as if they were my own. 
    I look forward to meeting you and your furry friends soon!</font></p></center><br><!-- About Me content, changed font size to look bigger. -->
